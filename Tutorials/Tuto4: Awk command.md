##  Pracatical for Awk command

 * By the end of this tutorial you will be able to : 
   - Improve text processing skills.
   - Extract & Transform your data.
   - Clean & validate your data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### +++ Print-Command examples : 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the gff file exmaple from this link above in your working directory Dir3. 
   - Check your path, use pwd command.
   - Hint : use wget command to download the file.
   - link : 

2. To print the content of your file please type this command;

```markdown
 cat GFFgile 
```

3. Print out the content of the GFFfile by "Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan" command;

```markdown
awk '{print}' GFFfile 
```

4. Repeat question 3 and substitute "{print}" by " '//' ", is there any difference ? 

```markdown
awk '//' mGFFfile 
```

5. Repeat question 3 and substitute "print" by "print $0", is there any difference ? 

```markdown
awk '{print $0}' GFFfile 
```

6. In case you wanted to print a ormatted output, you may type; 

```markdown
awk '{printf $0}' GFFfile 
```

7. How many lines contain the GFFfile. ( use wc command with the option -l ); 

```markdown
 cat GFFgile | wc -l 
```

8. To print the current line number using awk just type;

```markdown
awk '{print NR}' GFFfile  
```

* If you are confused and you wanted to check again, you could pipe the previous command's output to wc -l command. 

9. Note that awk is a programming language, so you can use implement many options using a single command, First lets print how many field contains each line; 

```markdown
awk '{print NF}' GFFfile 
```

10. Now Try to append NF and NR in one command ;

<summary> Hint </summary>
<p> You could write a string in your command exp awk '{ ... ,"your string", ...}' input </p> 
</details>
<details>
<summary> Answer: </summary>

```markdown
 awk '{print "The number of field in line",NR," is : ", NF}' GFFfile 
```
</details>

10. Supposing that You wanted to print out specific fields, awk offer you this ability, try to print field number 1,3,4,5,7,9 then redirect the output to a  modified newfile named mGFFfile;

```markdown
awk  '{print $1,$3,$4,$5,$7,$9}' GFFfile > mGFFfile
```

11. Inspect your new file use " more " command.
  - See that mFFfile bacame non a tab separated file so to get your output in "\t" format, change awkâ€™s default behaviour by using the "Output Field Separator(OFS)" 

```markdown
awk  'BEGIN {OFS="\t"} {print $1,$3,$4,$5,$7,$9}' GFFfile > mGFFfile
```

  - Inspect again your new file. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### +++ Filter lines based on conditions: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In this part of the TUTO we will work only on mGFFfile. 

12. Extract only lines which contain CDS; 

```markdown
 awk '/CDS/' mGFFfile 
```

* To be more acurate you can specify the field(column); 

```markdown
awk '$2=="CDS" {print}' mGFFfile 
```

13. Extract lines which contain CDS or data with End position greater 5000 ( column 4 ) ; 
  - for more information about gff files : please visit ; http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff3.html

```markdown
awk '$2=="CDS" || $3>5000 {print}' mGFFfile
```

14. Repeat question 13 then print out both lines with CDS which contain end position > 5000; 

```markdown
awk '$2=="CDS" && $3>5000 {print}' mGFFfile 
```

15. Print only unique type of feature ( $2 ); 

```markdown
awk -F'\t' '{print $2}' mGFFfile | uniq
```
